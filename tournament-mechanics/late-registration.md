# Late Registration

It is at the discretion of tournament organizers how late player registration is done. It is recommended that late registration is not allowed after first-round pairings are posted or after draft pod seating arrangements have been determined. Tournament organizers should clearly announce tournament start times and interested players should be attentive and mindful of round times.
