# Sleeves and Plastic Protectors

Players are allowed to use card sleeves for their decks. All cards in a player’s main deck must use identical sleeves and all cards in a player’s material deck must also use identical sleeves. Players are allowed to use different sleeves between the main deck and material deck but all sleeves within each group must match. Cards in the sideboard may be left unsleeved but must match the sleeve of the deck it is sideboarded into. If any markings appear on the sleeve, these markings may only be visible on the side with the face of the card and may not uniquely identify or distinguish the card.

Players can request for a judge to inspect their opponent’s card sleeves during a match.

Judges reserve the authority to disallow the use of sleeves if the sleeves are deemed too damaged, marked, or having a condition or design interfering with gameplay or shuffling. If sleeves are disallowed on this basis, they can ask that a player replace the sleeves. If a player is unable or unwilling to replace the sleeves, judges may require that player to play the remainder of the tournament without sleeves. For timely gameplay, unless there is a compelling reason for sleeves to be replaced or changed during a game or round, replacements should be done after a match is finished or between rounds.

Significantly disruptive designs that produce intense reflections or other significant visual effects are not allowed. Tournament organizers and judges reserve the right to disallow the use of any sleeves deemed inappropriate or disruptive to the venue or the gameplay.
