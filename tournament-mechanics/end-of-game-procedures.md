# End of Game Procedures

Once a game ends, players in the game proceed through the following steps:

1. Players turn all characteristically-defined, face-down cards in all public zones face-up.
2. Players determine if the game-winning player has won enough games to have won the match. If a player wins the match, players proceed through go through [End of Match procedures](end-of-match-procedures.md).
3. If no player has won the match, players may begin sideboarding for the subsequent game.
4. After sideboarding is finished, players go through Start of Game Procedures and begin the next game: The losing player may select who becomes the first turn player for the next game. They may do this at any point until step 3 of [Start of Game Procedures](start-of-game-procedures.md). If they do not designate a first turn player, they are assumed to be the first turn player.

At the end of a game, any face-down cards in public zones must be turned face-up and revealed to all players before cards are collected for sideboarding and reshuffling.
