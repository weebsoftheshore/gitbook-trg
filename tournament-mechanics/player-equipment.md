# Player Equipment

At a minimum, players should provide their main deck, material deck, an optional sideboard, dice (recommended D6 dice), pen, and paper. At more casual rule enforcement tiers, pen and paper can be substituted with another appropriate manner to track champion damage counters (such as with a die or another counter) or an electronic note-taking method. Players may ask tournament organizers to borrow pen and paper, however, it is at the discretion of the tournament organizer to have these available and whether to lend these out to players.

Players should not bring any equipment or gaming paraphernalia that is offensive, inappropriate, or may be seen as such by others present at the tournament venue. Players may always confer with a judge and/or tournament organizer if they have questions about whether their personal effects may be deemed offensive or inappropriate. Judges and tournament organizers reserve the authority to disallow the use of any materials deemed inappropriate/offensive. As general guidelines, any art, depictions, text, or portrayals on the equipment that might reasonably make another player uncomfortable, at a minimum, and would reasonably detract from their experience in a competitive setting, the materials should be reviewed with a judgement issued.

Regarding the use of “Generated” cards, players must provide tournament-legal copies of cards they anticipate generating in a game. If a player attempts to generate the card but can't produce a physical owned copy of the card (with matching sleeve, if applicable), the generate will fail that card.

Players should also be able to represent or designate any summoned objects in a clear manner throughout the game.
