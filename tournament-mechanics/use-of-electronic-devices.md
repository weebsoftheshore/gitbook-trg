# Use of Electronic Devices

Players may use electronic device to take notes, as discussed in the prior section on [In-game Notation](in-game-notation.md) Internet-capable devices may be used to access basic information such as looking up cards on the Index. If a device is to be used for this purpose, it must be set aside in plain view for all players in the match while accessing the Index. Players may not access online deck lists unless allowed by the Tournament Organizer. Brief personal calls are allowed (should not exceed 3 minutes). If a player wishes to access the device for any other personal reasons, they must request and receive permission from a judge. Use of all electronic devices is not allowed during a draft or deck Construction.
