# End of Match Procedures

At the end of a match, players must agree on the match result, record and/or report the result to the event recorder, and clear the playing area of any cards, dice, and other equipment and belongings.



#### Timed Rounds for Non-Single Elimination:

If time in the round has expired and the winner of the current game is not yet determined, the current turn player will finish their turn, then players have up to 5 minutes to finish the game or play 3 additional turns, whichever comes first. The current turn player will be considered as starting on turn 0, after which up to 3 additional turns are played[.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOrgLj9lOwk) If time is called as the turn player is announcing that they are ending their turn, the next player’s turn will start the turn counter. If, after 5 minutes or the turn limit, there is no winner, the game is considered a draw. The player with the most wins thus far in the match is considered the match winner. If neither player has won more games, the match is a draw.

Once round time has been called, no new games in a match can begin and match results should be reported. Judges may put in place a time extension not to exceed 5 minutes. If a time extension is applied in this manner, round-ending procedures will not begin until the time extension is over.

Awarded time extensions are completed before the three additional turns or 5 additional minutes given for timed rounds can be followed through.

#### Timed Rounds for Single Elimination:

For timed single-elimination rounds, matches can’t end in a draw. Once players have finished the 3 additional turns or 5 minutes have passed, whichever comes first, and a winner of the match is not yet determined, the following steps are used to determine the match winner.

1. The player with more games won wins the match. If neither player has won more games, advance to Step 2.
2. The player controlling the champion with the highest available life pool wins the current game. If this step determines a game-winner, players go back to Step 1. If both champions have equal available health pools, advance to Step 3.

{% hint style="info" %}
E.g. A champion with a life stat of 30 with 10 damage counters is considered to have 20 available life pool. A champion with a life stat of 25 with 4 damage counters is considered to have a 21 available life pool. In this case, the player controlling the champion with the 4 damage counters would win.
{% endhint %}

3. The player with the highest [influence](https://app.gitbook.com/s/n9JVmMhIsFO8d99Lam5B/glossary/game-terms#influence) wins the game.  If this step determines a game winner, players go back to Step 1. If both players’ influences are equal, advance to Step 4.
4. The player with the most cards in their Main Deck wins the game. If both players have equal cards in their Main Deck, the player who took the final turn of the game wins. Then players go back to Step 1 to determine a match winner.



#### Ending Overtime

If a game is in the process of being played when overtime is finished for that match, the game should be considered over if players are currently in a main phase and the Effects Stack is empty.

1. If there is a combat phase in progress, finish resolving all parts of it. The game will end after it returns to the main phase and the Effects Stack is empty.
2. If the game is not in a combat phase and there are triggers, activations, or other effects pending resolution, those actions should be resolved. Players may still receive and pass Opportunity and take player actions until the stack is fully resolved. When it is empty, the game ends.
   1. A resolving attack card may begin and complete its discrete combat phase and all parts therein before the match concludes. After the combat phase and the game returns to the main phase where the stack is empty, the game ends.
