# In-game Notation

Players may take written notes during a match. The sheet or device on which those notes are written must be visibly empty and remain visible throughout the match. Players can’t refer to notes from prior or other matches. Other players may not request that the contents of the notes be revealed/made public. They may also not request that the contents be interpreted by the player taking notes or by judges. However, judges may request to see the notes, the sheet or device they were written on, and/or have the player explain the notes to them discreetly. Any extra notes made before the start of the match must be removed from the play area before the start of game 1 in that match series. Digitally written notes follow the same guidelines as written notes; notes from prior matches must be cleared/deleted before the start of the next match.

Players are strongly encouraged to keep a written record of champion damage counters (damage dealt or recovered) throughout games. Recorded damage can be of great help to judges during judge calls.

No outside resources that may offer instructional, strategic, or decision-making assistance may be used.

Players can’t take notes while drafting in a limited tournament but may still take notes as normally allowed during playing matches within the tournament.
