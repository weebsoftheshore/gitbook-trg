# In-game Notation

Players may take written notes during a match. There are basic rules to follow for notetaking:

1. The sheet or device on which those notes are written must be visibly empty and remain visible throughout the match.
2. Players can’t refer to notes from prior or other matches.&#x20;
3. Other players may not request that the contents of a player's notes to be revealed/made public.
4. They may also not request that the contents be interpreted by the player taking notes or by judges.
   1. However, judges may request to see the notes, the sheet or device they were written on, and/or have the player explain the notes to them discreetly.
5. Any extra notes made before the start of the match must be removed from the play area before the start of game 1 in that match series.&#x20;
6. Digitally written notes follow the same guidelines as written notes; notes from prior matches must be cleared/deleted before the start of the next match.
7. No outside resources that may offer instructional, strategic, or decision-making assistance may be used.
8. Players can’t take notes while drafting in a limited tournament, but may still take notes as normally allowed during playing matches within the tournament.
9. When taking notes on revealed information, players may not pause or suspend the match for more than 1 minute to do so. Any additional note-taking is expected to be done from the player's ability to recall the revealed information and should not impede the pace of play. After this time allotted for notetaking, the owner of the revealed cards is not obligated to keep them revealed and can't be prevented from continuing to play.

Players are strongly encouraged to keep a written record of champion damage counters (damage dealt or recovered) throughout games. Recorded damage can be of great help to judges during judge calls.
