# Dropping from Tournaments

Players may drop from a tournament at any time. If they do so before the 1st round, they will have been considered as not having participated in the tournament. Dropping from the tournament must be reported to the event recorder before the generation of pairings. If a player wishes to drop after pairings have been made, they will be considered to have conceded and lost that match 0-1-0 and will be dropped afterward. Players that are not physically present for a tournament may be dropped automatically by the event reporter. Some exceptions or extensions may be allowed if a judge is informed before the absence if the player returns or will return shortly. Players may appeal being dropped by the event reporter to the leading judge for re-entry with their current score and standing, as applicable.

Players dropping from a limited format tournament owns all cards they correctly have in their possession from the tournament at that time including drafted cards, unopened packs, and/or partially drafted cards.

Players may not drop from a tournament in exchange for or influenced by the offer of any reward or incentive.
