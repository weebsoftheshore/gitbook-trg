# Intentional Draws and Concessions

Players may intentionally draw games and/or matches by mutual agreement at any time except for during elimination rounds and only if the first game in a match has not been started. Intentional draws are recorded as 0 Wins - 0 Losses for the players in a match. Once the first game in a match has begun, players may not intentionally draw.

Players can concede a game and/or match at any time. When a player concedes a game or a match, it will be considered a game loss or a match loss for that player, respectively, and reported as such. Players should notify judges if they wish to concede. If a player refuses to play a game or a match, that player is considered to be conceding the game or match. If all players refuse to play a game or match, the match result is recorded as a loss for all players in that match.



Players can’t concede in exchange for any kind of consideration. See [Bribes](../tournament-violations/bribes.md).
