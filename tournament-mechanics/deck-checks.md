# Deck Checks

Deck Checks are a regular process in tournament settings. They are a useful tool to ensure tournament integrity by allowing Judges to verify player deck legality. Players may ask that their opponent's deck is checked if there is concern for a deck issue or undue action. Tournament officials should run deck checks regularly throughout the event.

Below is a general guideline for how Deck Checks may be conducted:

1. Players should present the decks (Material, Main) and sideboard they are using in the tournament to the Judge completing the deck check. If applicable, players should also present their deck box or cardholder and any other equipment necessary for the deck check. If there are any questions of concerns regarding altered or proxied cards, they should be asked before the cards are presented for deck checks.
2. Judges should then organize the cards according to the appropriate deck and sideboard zones and ensure that proper card counts are found in each zone.
3. After the cards are sorted and accounted for, cards should be verified to ensure that no inappropriate markings are noted.  If sleeves are being used, cards in the main deck must all be sleeved identically. The same is true for cards in the material deck, though main deck and material deck cards can be sleeved differently. Sideboard cards do not need to be sleeved until they are added to or replace cards in either the main or material deck, after which they are expected to be sleeved according to main or material deck rules.
   1. It is recommended that after the cards have been sorted and checked for markings that the cards are then shuffled again together to look for inconsistencies or patterns in cards that overly protrude or are more easily noticeable than others.
4. Any concerns for violations of guidelines should be addressed using the Infraction Policy Guide.
