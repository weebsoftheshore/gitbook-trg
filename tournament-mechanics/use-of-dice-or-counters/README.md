# Use of Dice or Counters

Players should be explicit as to what a die represents and what value is being presented to represent the intended value. If a die is being rolled, players must be clear and explicit about what the face values will determine.

When counters (which may be dice) are used, players should be explicit as to what the counter is being used to represent and should be clear if the use of the counter is being modified or changed to reflect a different value or metric. Each counter can only be used to reflect a single value or metric and cannot be used to represent multiple values simultaneously.
