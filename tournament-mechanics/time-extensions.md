# Time Extensions

If a judge pauses a match for more than 1 minute while the round timer is running, the match time should be extended proportionally. Matches are allowed 5 minutes of overtime by default, however, judges are allowed to add up to another 5 minutes to the timer each round. For larger events where it may take time for a judge to reach a table for a judge call, judges are recommended to apply a proportional time extension for that match.
