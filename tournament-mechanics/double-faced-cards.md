# Double-Faced Cards

With the launch of Abyssal Heaven, Grand Archive introduced "double-faced cards" to the game. These cards will have specific rules that players must follow if their decks contain any number of these cards in any of the decks. Sideboards may be excluded from the following requirements.\


1. Players that use double-faced cards in a tournament setting are obligated to use them in a fully sleeved deck. This will require players to follow any guidelines related to [Sleeves and Plastic Protectors](sleeves-and-plastic-protectors.md). While clear sleeves would be permissible for regular (i.e. non-double-faced cards), this is not true for double-faced cards. Specifically, sleeves used must be completely opaque. This is defined as: No part, characteristic, or element can be seen, identified, or suspected of being part of a double-faced card from examining the card from the opaque side of the sleeve. This means that, even is a double-faced card is only mostly obstructed but is transparent enough to differentiate that it is a double-faced card of some kind rather than having a standard Grand Archive card back (with the Grand Archive logo) then it is not allowed for tournament use if that card is in the Main or Material decks.

Try to use dark card sleeves in colors such as black, dark grey, navy blue, or purple, or sleeves that have an opaque and artistic back that may properly hide any possible information gained from a card's back.

2. Players may not substitute a regular Grand Archive card as a proxy for a double-faced card. Only the proper double-faced card may be used to represent itself in a deck. This _does_ include any copies in the sideboard.
3. Players are allowed to use a duplicate copy of the intended double-faced card, held clearly and separately of any cards in their Main or Material deck for the express use of placing the duplicate on top of the actual card in the decklist to reflect or represent a "transformed" state of the card. These duplicate cards do not need to be sleeved and may also be sleeved in a different style sleeve that are not required to follow the opacity requirements for double-faced cards. Otherwise, players are expected to physically flip double-faced cards when they transform to reflect its correct state.

If using the same sleeves for the duplicate, remember to remove all extra copies of the double-faced card from the appropriate zones before starting a new game or a new match. Any extra copies in this way will be counted as, at minimum, a deck issue and result in a game loss according to the [Infractions Policy Guide](https://ipg.gatcg.com/).

4. As long as a player has information permissions on a double-faced card (i.e. public information or the card is private to them), that player may pick up and examine both sides of the double-faced card. Players should ask the permission of another player before picking up double-faced cards to examine that they do not own or they do not currently control. Players have the option to request information of the card through the Index by asking a Judge for assistance.
5. If a double-faced card is found to be on the wrong side at the start of a game or before that card has been played, this will not be considered a deck issue under infractions and the player is allowed to flip it at any time, though it is recommended they do so as they play the card to reflect its correct state and to avoid disadvantage accidental disclosure of information.
