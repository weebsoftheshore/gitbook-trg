# Card and Sleeve Markings

Players should ensure that their cards and sleeves are not marked during the course of the tournament. Any discernable scratch, discoloration, bend, or other manifested change in the card or sleeve is considered to be a marking. Players may not roughly handle another player’s cards and should be respectful when handling them to avoid inadvertently marking or damaging the card. Intentional damage or destruction of a player’s cards or property is illegal.
