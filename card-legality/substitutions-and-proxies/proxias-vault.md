# Proxia's Vault

Cards within Proxia’s Vault are excluded from most rules regarding proxies. Any card printed from the Vault as a tournament proxy must be printed in full color with all of the text easily identifiable and legible. If a player uses a proxied card in their Material Deck during a tournament, their entire material deck must be sleeved with identical sleeves. If thin or typical printer paper is used to print the proxy cards, they must be held in the sleeve with another Grand Archive card (to provide a stiffer backing). Proxied versions of the card must follow the same guidelines with respect to card alters, as well.\

All cards in Proxia's Vault can be proxied indefinitely as long as the card is in Proxia's Vault.
