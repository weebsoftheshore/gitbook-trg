# Substitutions and Proxies

Judges reserve the authority to distribute proxy cards for use if a card becomes damaged or unusable as an authorized card during the course of a tournament. Judges may either issue a proxy replacement for a card requiring replacement or may ask that a player replace the card with another legal card from their sideboard (if the card needing replacement was in the main deck).

Players may ask judges to issue them proxies if they feel there is a compelling reason for a judge to do so, however, it is at the discretion of the judge/head judge to provide such a proxy.

Judges may use an inconsequential Grand Archive card (such as a Spirit of Fire or Spirit of Wind) and mark over the card using a permanent marker or pen to indicate the name/cost/element of the intended card being proxied.
