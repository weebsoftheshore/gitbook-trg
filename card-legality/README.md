# Card Legality

Only authorized cards may be used in tournaments of Grand Archive. These cards cannot be grossly physically altered in any way and cannot be counterfeit or “fake” versions of the represented card. If a fake/counterfeit card is used unknowingly and a player is made aware of this fact either by another player or a judge, that player must cease using that card and replace it with an authorized card. Tournament Organizers, judges, and other personnel do not have the authority to confiscate fake/counterfeit cards, and doing so is illegal. Judges reserve the right to determine whether a card is acceptable for tournament use or not. This may be appealed.

Authorized cards have the official Grand Archive TCG card back, standard round-cut corners, and are those that have been officially printed via Weebs of the Shore for Grand Archive. Miscut cards that do not conform to the standard authorized card dimensions and appearance are not permissible. Similarly, cards from an uncut sheet must be prepared to be identical to the standard cut Grand Archive cards. If a card is otherwise modified or exists in a non-standard state, it will not be considered permissible for tournament use. Cards that are excessively damaged such that they might be uniquely identifiable from other authorized cards are not permitted for use. Otherwise, Authorized cards must be legal for the format of tournament play it is intended to be used for.

Misprinted cards are acceptable for use provided that a full and clearly represented name, correct matching element, and correct matching cost appear together on the card, correlated with the appropriate card in the Index. Any artistic alterations to cards are permissible only if such an alteration does not cause the card to be uniquely identifiable from other standard Grand Archive cards or does not produce a significant degree of physical alteration to the card. Cards may also not be marked in a distinguishable manner on any side or edge of the card. If sleeves are used, the sleeves must not be marked or damaged in a distinguishable manner, as well.

The following elements must be completely visible and may not be obscured in any way:

* Card name
* Reserve/Memory Costs
* Champion card level indicators
* Element name AND symbol
* Card type symbol
* Card stat symbols AND text (life, power, durability, speed, etc)

If any of the above items are covered, hidden, or made to be unclear, the card is not permitted for use in tournament play.

Items permissible for artistic obstruction/alteration:

* Border/Border information (such as set ID, artist, rarity symbol, etc.)
* Typeline text (Symbol MUST be completely visible)
* Art box
* Any/all of the rules text box.

Additionally, the artistic content of alters cannot depict obscene or offensive elements. Artistic content should also not make the card unrecognizable Again, judges may determine if a given card is permissible and any rejections can be appealed to the Head Judge.
