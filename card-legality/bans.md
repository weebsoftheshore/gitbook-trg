# Bans

Bans of cards are format-specific and govern which cards may be included in any part of a decklist for a given deck (Main Deck, Material Deck, Sideboard). If a card is banned in a format, it can't be included in a decklist for that format in any quantity. Bans will not affect the player's ability to play the card if the card is introduced into a match through means such as Generate.

As a reminder, rule 1 of Generate, per the comprehensive rules, states the following:\
\
Generate defines the player action of generating cards, or adding cards from outside the game permanently for the remainder of a game of Grand Archive. Generated cards do not persist after the conclusion of a game; any generated cards will be removed from the play area and corresponding zones after a game has ended.
