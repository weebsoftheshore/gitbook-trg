# Round Times

For all tournament matches, the first game may not begin until the official match timer has begun.

BO3 matches of Grand Archive are recommended to be played with 60-minute round time limits (excluding time or round extensions for any reason). Single-elimination match of Grand Archive should follow the same round time limits. For drafting, the same standard for 60-minute round time limits is recommended. BO1 matches may use the full 60-minute round setting, if necessary, though it is likely that all matches in a round will conclude before this duration. If this is the case, the round can be ended prematurely and the next round can begin.

Team Standard Constructed will use 50 minutes for the round times.

Judges may extend matches by up to 5 minutes (when appropriate) and end of round procedures follow the regular 3 turns or 5 minute extension, whichever comes first.
