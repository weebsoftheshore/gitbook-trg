# Team Standard Constructed

For Team Standard Constructed, players play on teams of 3 where each player is designated as player A, B, or C. Each player should provide their own main deck and material deck. There is no sideboard for this format.

\
Main decks must have a minimum of 60 cards with no more than four copies of any card. The four-copy restriction also applies across each team. E.g. Players A, B, and C can't each have 4 Refurbish cards in their main decks. The same applies to material decks and copies across material decks on a team, i.e., no more than one copy. There is no maximum deck size, however, players must be able to shuffle their main decks unassisted. Players can request assistance from a judge with shuffling if they feel there is a compelling reason to receive such assistance.

* Material decks have a 12-card limit, must have at least one Lv 0 champion, and cannot contain more than one copy of any one card.
* Players can't use the same Lv 0 Spirit champions in their Material decks. Named spirit cards are treated as an alias of their counterparts.

E.g. Player A and player B in a team cannot simultaneously use Spirit of Fire and Aithne, Spirit of Fire in a Team Standard Constructed event.

In this format, games are played in a setting of three simultaneous matches between players A, B, and C from one team against corresponding players from another team. Seating arrangements will consistently be A-B-C and each player will only play against the other team's matching player in seating order. A plays A, B plays B, etc. Only one game is played per paired player and each game win awards a team a point. The winner of a match in Team Standard constructed is the team with the most points after the three games conclude. A win is worth 3 points, a loss is worth 0 points, and a draw is worth 1 point.

Teams must decide and declare their seating arrangement before the tournament begins. This seating arrangement will be kept constant for the entire tournament.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Player A, B, and C cannot change positions such that player A becomes seated in B's or C's position, player B becomes seated in player A's or C's position, etc.
{% endhint %}

Players may communicate with the closest teammate(s) in their seating arrangement. Such communication will not be considered outside assistance. Player A may not communicate with Player C in seating arrangements by any means. Other rules surrounding player communication still apply regarding appropriate and respectful communication.
