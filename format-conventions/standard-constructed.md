# Standard Constructed

For Standard Constructed tournaments, each player should provide their own main deck, material deck, and sideboard for the tournament.&#x20;

\
Main decks must have a minimum of 60 cards with no more than four copies of any card. There is no maximum deck size, however, players must be able to shuffle their main decks unassisted. Players can request assistance from a judge with shuffling if they feel there is a compelling reason to receive such assistance.

* Material decks have a 12-card limit, must have at least one Lv 0 champion, and cannot contain more than one copy of any one card.
* Sideboards can contain a maximum of 15 cards. Sideboards use a 15 point system where cards in the Main Deck are worth 1 point and Regalia/Champion cards are worth 3 points. Sideboards can consist of any combination of Main Deck cards and Regalia/Champion cards that does not exceed 15 points or 15 cards for the Sideboard.



Players can access their sideboard and move cards between it and their main or material decks between games before both players are ready to present their shuffled decks and before any starting hands have been drawn.
