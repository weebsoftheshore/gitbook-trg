# Tournament Byes

Byes in a tournament can occur whenever a player either received an exemption from playing the round (such as with some invitation-style tournaments) or by not having been paired with an opponent during a round, usually due to odd player counts or playing having dropped. In these situations, the player who received a round bye will be noted as having won their match for the round, scored 2-0-0 (W-L-D for BO3), and then reported to the event recorder.
