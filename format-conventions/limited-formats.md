# Limited Formats

For any formats described as limited (typically draft and sealed events), players will construct their decks during the event; they will not provide their own preconstructed decks for matches.

Main decks must have a minimum of 30 cards and material decks will have a maximum of 10 cards.

* Material decks have the same restrictions as material decks in Standard; players may only have one copy of a card in the material deck.
* Main decks follow the same restrictions as main decks in Stadnard; players may only have up to 4 copies of any card in the Main Deck.
* Any cards obtained during construction that are not in either the main or material decks are considered a player’s sideboard.

Players will be able to exchange cards from their sideboard with cards in their main or material decks between games before drawing an opening hand and may change the composition of their deck at any time between rounds. It is recommended that players only play against others in their draft pod, but tournament organizers may choose to ignore this recommendation, especially for larger tournaments, or may combine players from different pods during top cuts.
