# Match Results

Match results cannot be determined by coin tosses, rolling of dice, playing sub-games, playing other games, or any other method that deviates from the normal course of gameplay. Wins, losses, and draws may only be determined from the course of events in a game in the tournament and cannot be based on external factors. Intentional draws are allowed if they do not involve bribery or wagers and only if they occur before the first game of a match.
