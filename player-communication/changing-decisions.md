# Changing Decisions

Players should be expected to play games with the intention that their cards, game state, and decision options have been carefully considered before taking any player actions. Physical and/or verbal commitments to a player's action are expected to be followed through, though players should be explicit in communicating the intended action. However, wrong decisions can occur and there are some cases in which changing a decision is permissible. If no new information is gained by that player in wanting to reverse a decision or make another choice, judges may allow a play to be taken back. Players may not leverage opponents’ expressions or lack of reactions to decide whether they should take back or modify a decision. If there is any suspicion that information may have been gained, or that it is uncertain if new information was gained, the decision should not be allowed to be reverted. In general, reverting decisions may be permissible if no significant change in the game state or information about the game state has occurred after the initial course of action.
