# Shortcuts

Shortcuts in gameplay can take place. These actions can skip certain steps or small processes that might occur in a game. This allows players in a game to progress through a match smoothly. Shortcutting relies on clear communication between players and a shared understanding of the process involved in the shortcut. Shortcuts must generally be approved for use in a tournament setting or must be done in such a way that it does not create an unclear game state. If a shortcut is intended to be made that is not a common shortcut, an approved shortcut, or is not mutually understood by all persons in a tournament, the shortcut must be explicitly and clearly defined and demonstrated. if needed, a judge can assist in ruling over a shortcut and intervening, if necessary.

* Players adding an additional ability or card activation to the Effects Stack will be considered as having passed Opportunity by default unless they explicitly state they are maintaining Opportunity to act.

{% hint style="info" %}
If a player (A) wishes to add multiple card activations or abilities simultaneously onto the effect stack, it is presumed they are doing so one by one with each effect resolving if they did not explicitly state they are holding Opportunity. If another player (B) expresses they would like to act at any point in the middle of all of these player (A) actions, the actions taken so far are reversed to the point at which that player (B) would like to act.
{% endhint %}

* If a player activates a card or ability with choices that are made intended for when that object resolves, they are obligated to follow those choices unless another player responds. If another player does, and that card or ability resolves, the on-resolution choices may be changed.
* A player that is instructed to glimpse but does not look at any cards is assumed to have not looked and chosen to leave the cards in the order they are currently in.
* Players may ask that other players pause at certain points in a turn if they intend to perform a player action at that time to avoid accidentally taking a shortcut to progress the game phase.
