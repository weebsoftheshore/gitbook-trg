# Sequencing Errors

Complex interactions may occur frequently in a game of Grand Archive. Players may sometimes wish to take a series of actions that result in a legal and unambiguous game state upon completion however, this may sometimes happen in illegal sequences. Opponents may ask that the player repeat the actions with correct sequencing to allow for appropriate and legal responses. Such sequences cannot result in additional information gained that might affect decision-making for that player or any other players in the game. Players may also not attempt to fish for opponents’ reactions to sequences of play to seek out modification of that sequence. sequencing errors cannot allow players to retroactively take missed actions. If there is a substantial time after a sequence has been announced and performed, it is considered that the sequence is finished and that the game state can progress to a new point.

Common sequencing error examples:

* Moving to materialization or attempting to materialize a card before waking up objects
* Resolving On Death abilities before placing that object into the graveyard
* Drawing a card from the Draw Phase after starting the Main Phase
* Paying costs of card activations or materializations before revealing the intended card

Players are expected to follow through on execution of the intended action, correcting the sequencing in the process. Only if the intended sequence is illegal can the actions be taken back and the game state reverted to the time before the sequence was tried.
