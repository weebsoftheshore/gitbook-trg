# Loops and Iteration

Loops are considered actions or a sequence of events that can occur an arbitrary amount of times, each iteration completed identically through that sequence of actions. players must demonstrate a loop exists by performing an action or sequence of actions that do not produce a conditional effect. If a sequence of actions results in the player being required to make a decision or where they intentionally make a choice, it is either not considered a loop or will stop being a loop at that point, if a player was demonstrating a loop previously. If a loop can be demonstrated to be “infinite,” the player must choose a number equal to how many times they wish to iterate through the loop. When this is done, that loop will iterate that many times; players cannot choose “infinity” as a number. If a loop depends on hidden information for continuity, a judge may be called to determine the continuity of the loop. Loops must be deterministic, i.e., the outcome of the loop must produce the same effects for each iteration in the loop.&#x20;

Loops must be able to progress the state of the game. If a loop or series of iterations in a loop does not produce a meaningful progression of the game state, a judge may rule that the player must take different actions.&#x20;

E.g. If an arbitrary n iterations of a loop does not change the game state from the current state to the state after the iterations are completed, it is not considered to be meaningful.

Shortcut example using iteration or looping:

* Drawing n cards using a champion’s ability to remove 3 enlighten counters to draw a card. 3n counters will be removed and the player will draw n cards after concluding the loop.
{% endhint %}
