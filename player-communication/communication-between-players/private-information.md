# Private Information

Private information is any information that players can only access from their position in the game considering their view on the game state and access to private information. Except for the main deck, most face-down cards, and the identities (not number of) cards in hand and memory typically fall within this category. Players cannot freely access private information that is in whole or part hidden from them from their perspective in the game and, though players may be asked about private information, players are not obligated to share their private information. If any questions arise about whether specific information is public or private, judges may be called to clarify this.

Players have the liberty to discuss any private information known to them to any other players in a game, they may not explicitly reveal this information publicly unless instructed to by an effect.
