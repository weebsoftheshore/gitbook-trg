# Status Information

Status information is information that Must constantly be tracked at all times. Changes in this information must always be explicitly announced and tracked in the course of a game. Tracking this change must be clearly visible to all players in a game and must be agreed upon as an acceptable method. Acceptable methods are any methods that all players can access it. Use of dice that may be easily and accidentally changed, or shifted/disturbed is not advised. Status information in Grand Archive will typically be in the form of damage counters to be tracked on champions.
