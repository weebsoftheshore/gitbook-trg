# Triggers

Players are responsible for remembering their own triggered abilities; players are not obligated to point out triggered abilities they do not control. Players intentionally leaving triggers unacknowledged constitutes cheating. Players may inadvertently forget about a triggered ability. Such abilities are considered forgotten and will have subsequently not entered the Effects Stack. Forgotten triggers that specify a “may” component that gives the controller a choice as to whether that ability takes effect will assume the ability was declined. Abilities without a permissive or optional component are handled via rules enforcement.
