# Play Area and Game Layout

There is no formal method of representing zones, cards in zones, or the various decks in a play area. Broadly, requirements are that the main deck and material decks are each separate and plainly visible and that the graveyard and banishment are explicitly noted and visible. Furthermore, champions should be placed such that they are clearly and easily visible in the play area. The memory zone should not be confused with any other face-down cards and should be positioned closer to the player whereas objects in the game are positioned closer to the opponent(s). It is recommended that the main deck, graveyard, and banishment are all kept to either the right or left side of a player and that the material deck be positioned on the opposite side. Cards in one zone may be referenced or tied to by an ability of a card in another zone; this relationship should be clearly denoted and represented.

It is recommended that players adhere to the following conventions of card layouts during a game of Grand Archive:

* The main deck and material deck should be on opposite sides, left and right, of the player. E.g. If the main deck is on the player’s left, the material deck should be to the player’s right.
* The graveyard should be kept in front of or adjacent to the main deck.
* Banishment should be either set off to the side or represented in an organized pile horizontally beneath the graveyard or in front of the graveyard.
* Cards in the memory zone should be kept directly in front of the player near the end of the table. Cards in the memory zone should be kept in a manner that makes each card easily singled out, if possible and reasonable.
* Cards in hand should be held in hand or may be temporarily set face-down together on the table when needed.
* Champions may be set upright in front of the controlling player either in the center of the playing area or in a corner of the playing area near the material deck (but not further out than the material deck).
* Weapons should be kept near the champion.
* Regalia should be kept near each other in an area of the play area.
* Allies should be maintained in front of the player in front of the memory zone and in the center of the board adjacent to the champion or flanking the champion if the champion is centered.
* If any cards exist in a zone that is referenced or tied via an ability to another card or object, that card can be placed underneath or next to the tied card while the zone of the card is mentally tracked or physically denoted.
