# Judge Calls

While broad language surrounding judge calls may be found [here](../general-structure/judge-calls-and-appeals.md), this section will detail certain etiquette and expectations regarding players and judge calls or suspected violations for which a judge _should_ be called.

When a player suspects a violation has occurred, they should always make a judge call, even if nothing is corrected and no violation has occurred. Calls made in this capacity and in good faith help to ensure tournament integrity. In making these judge calls, below are some steps and criteria to follow to help communicate the suspected violation. Following these will help properly convey a potential violation and assist with any investigations or remedies to be applied.

* First, initiate the judge call according to the proper protocols or procedures of a tournament. Tournament staff should be explicit about how judge calls may be made if the setting or format makes the commonplace methods (e.g., raising a hand and calling out for a judge) difficult or unachievable. Prior to the judge's attendance, it may be prudent to also discuss the reason for the call with the opponent, but pausing the game and calling for a judge should take priority.
* Explain, as accurately as possible, the situation that occurred to the attending judge. Answer the judge's questions sincerely with as much detail as possible.
* Ask questions to the judge if there are any concerns or lapses in clarity regarding the resolution. It is always appropriate to take the due diligence to ensure that the judge can deliver a confident ruling with adequate explanation.
* Appeal a ruling if there is a reasonable feeling that the initial ruling was given incorrectly, either in part or wholly.

**Do-Not's:**

* Do not pass judgment, suggest, intimate, or otherwise insist on the kind of violation that may have occurred; this is part of the investigative process for the judges, and it is their responsibility to determine what happened, the corrective procedures, and the appropriate penalty.
* Do not seek outside opinions regarding an ongoing ruling or investigation. Judge calls and investigations should be handled specifically by the involved players, attending/Head Judge, and, if needed, tournament staff. After a final (unappealable) ruling has been issued, it may be acceptable to discuss with other judges and players as a retrospective to help form feedback regarding the situation; however, it is important to note that any one perspective may have bias.
* Do not take suspected violations to a public setting, especially if there is an ongoing investigation or a judge call attempting to remedy a potential violation.

Some settings, such as streamed games with a large audience, can permit general and untargeted questions about the match state that may either clarify any communication or alert staff to a potential violation, after which they may interject for further investigation.

* Do not use language that is overly negative or has malicious/accusatory connotation unless you are specifically concerned about (and have a strong case for) malicious conduct. Such concerns should be explicitly articulated during the call, but may not be used in bad faith to intimidate or otherwise make a player feel intimidated.
* Do not suggest what you think _should_ be the infraction and penalty unless such input is solicited or permitted. Players should never ask for or insist that another player is to be penalized; that is at the sole discretion of the judges and tournament staff.

Judges should also refrain from offering advice or opinions on actual scenarios unless they were part of the original call. It is often difficult to reach the right conclusion without being able to examine each perspective on a situation.
