# Prize Splits

Players may not openly or publicly discuss splitting of potential prizes from a tournament. Players may also not have these factors determine or impact match results; Match results must exclusively be determined by victory, concession, or intentional draws. It is understood that players may privately arrange or discuss potential splits for mutual benefit (e.g., players that are teammates or part of the same organization), but these discussions are not permitted in the tournament setting or in the tournament hall. This is primarily to avoid the possible appearance of collusion/bribery by players or spectators who do not understand or fail to communicate according to tournament policies.
