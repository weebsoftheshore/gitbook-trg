# Registration and Participation

TOs may require minimal information from players for registration in events, such as a player’s name. Typically, the player's Omnidex account should be used when registering a player for an event hosted through [Omnidex](https://omni.gatcg.com/). If a player does not have an account, they should be encouraged to create one. Players must be willing and able to provide the identifying information to participate in a tournament. TOs should announce/publish deadlines for tournament registration and players are expected to be aware of the deadlines to arrive on time for registration.

Tournament participation as a player is open to any persons over 13 years of age or with the approval/permission of their legal guardian/parent. People may be restricted from entry if prohibited by federal/state/local laws, rules enforced by the TO, or by management of a tournament venue. Tournament organizers may assist players in the application process.
