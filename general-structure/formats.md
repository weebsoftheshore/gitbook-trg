# Formats

Tournament formats fall into two broad categories: Constructed and Limited. Constructed formats require players to provide their own decks for tournament play while limited formats involve players constructing their deck at the tournament venue from sealed products.



Constructed

* [Standard](../format-conventions/standard-constructed.md): Players provide their own minimum 60-card Main Deck, maximum 12-card Material Deck, and maximum 15-card Sideboard ([see sideboard rules in detail here](../format-conventions/standard-constructed.md)). No more than 4 copies of a card can be present in the Main Deck at the start of a match.
* [Team Standard](../format-conventions/team-standard-constructed.md): In a team of three players, each player will bring their own minimum 60-card Main Deck and a maximum 12-card Material deck. Team Standard does not use a sideboard. Card restrictions, including the 4-copy limit, is shared across the entire team. Each player plays against a corresponding player on the other team (i.e. best-of-one).

Limited

* [Draft](../format-conventions/limited-formats.md): Players are placed in pods of up to 8 players and packs are randomly distributed from a single Main Set booster box such that each player has 6 packs each. Cards are drafted one at a time and players can freely add one Lv 0 spirit champion to complete their deck after drafting is finished. All cards not in either the Main Deck or Material Deck are considered sideboard cards. The Material deck is limited to a size of 10, unlike Constructed, and Main Decks only have a 30-card minimum size. Full details [here](../format-conventions/limited-formats.md).
* [Sealed](../format-conventions/limited-formats.md): Players are each provided a certain amount of products or a Sealed Kit from which they may make a deck. Instructions for constructing sealed event decks may change depending on the product or kit. Full details (HERE)
