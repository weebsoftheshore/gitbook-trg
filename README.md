1/23/2025

* Minor revisions to draft format regarding deck constraints. Construction rules follow standard deck construction rules regarding allowable numbers of copies of a card in addition to requiring only up to a single copy of a card in the material deck. The original rules were put in place early during DOA as a draft format with variations on the rules taking place for subsequent drafts. The intention is to standardize all base draft rules to the now-changed version and allow for any format-specific rules to be enumerated within the format.
* Updated section on drafting procedure for limited tournaments, detailing inclusion of sealed draft packs. Also modified language regarding suggested time constraints.
* Updated card legality section.
* Slightly changed wording in the player equipment section regarding inappropriate materials.
* Correctly updated policy on Proxia's Vault (no time limitation clause for proxy eligibility duration)
* Added slight wording for Start of Game procedures to account for "False starts" when players begin before a round timer has begun.
* Added brief section covering Media regulations. This covers basic rules for media coverage at higher-tier competitive events (e.g. Ascent, National). Each event will detail media policies in greater detail and, as such, this section will not be exhaustive in content and policy guidelines.
