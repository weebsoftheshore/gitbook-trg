If you would like to see the exact changes to any version of the rulebook, please check the GitBook commit history [here](https://github.com/weebsoftheshore/gitbook-trg/commits/main/).



1/22/25

* Addendum to Sleeves and Plastic Protectors section for the context of events of higher tiers than Store Championships. Players will be required to use sleeves for their decks in these tournaments. Simultaneously, we are disallowing clear/transparent sleeves for these tournaments.   This will be effective for enforcement on 1/26/26. Rationale for further context below:
  * Unsleeved cards are too easily marked/damaged/frayed from regular and extensive play during a tournament, thereby making them marked and prone to frequent inspection/replacement. Clear sleeves double the efforts for deck checks since it adds the step of inspecting card backs for markings. For the sake of tournament promptness and fairness, we are making the above requirements for premier play. Store Championships and Local events are not bound to this requirement to maintain the barrier of entry for new players and community participation.



12/4/25

* Updated legal products list, changed naming conventions of product on the list to shorten (does not change product legality; all legality rules are available on the Index, link at the top).
  * Phantom Monarchs and related products will become legal on December 5th (tomorrow) for tournament play for the official release.
* Additional commentary for [Stream Judging](media-coverage/stream-judging.md)
* Addendum 12/5/25 - Added brief section on [Bans](card-legality/bans.md)



9/26/25

* Correctly updated ban list to include Rile the Abyss, as discussed in prior B\&R article.<br>

9/11/25

*   Expanded upon Player Communication chapter, adding in section [Prize Splits](player-communication/prize-splits.md) and [Judge Calls](player-communication/judge-calls.md), as well as Media Coverage with [Stream Judging](media-coverage/stream-judging.md).

    * Prize Split discussions are now explicitly not to be public. This is mostly to avoid situations where players may inadvertently use language that may suggest bribery or collusion without the intent of doing so (where it otherwise would be permissible). Matches are always expected to only result from either victory or concession (achieved in-game), or an intentional draw. The result can't be decided any other way.
    * Judge Calls has been expanded to give a more detailed view of how players are expected to handle judge calls and pitfalls to avoid during judge calls. It is our hope that these guidelines can curb either unwarranted or unintentional misuse of the judging system.
    * Slightly more depth given to expectations regarding Stream Judging. For judge-specific information, more detail is always available in the official [Judge Handbook](https://jh.gatcg.com/).





8/18/25

* Reorganized and expanded section on [In-game Notation.](tournament-mechanics/in-game-notation.md) Additional support and guidance has been explored in the context of revealed information.

\
1/23/2025

* Minor revisions to draft format regarding deck constraints. Construction rules follow standard deck construction rules regarding allowable numbers of copies of a card in addition to requiring only up to a single copy of a card in the material deck. The original rules were put in place early during DOA as a draft format with variations on the rules taking place for subsequent drafts. The intention is to standardize all base draft rules to the now-changed version and allow for any format-specific rules to be enumerated within the format.
* Updated section on drafting procedure for limited tournaments, detailing inclusion of sealed draft packs. Also modified language regarding suggested time constraints.
* Updated card legality section.
* Slightly changed wording in the player equipment section regarding inappropriate materials.
* Correctly updated policy on Proxia's Vault (no time limitation clause for proxy eligibility duration)
* Added slight wording for Start of Game procedures to account for "False starts" when players begin before a round timer has begun.
* Added brief section covering Media regulations. This covers basic rules for media coverage at higher-tier competitive events (e.g. Ascent, National). Each event will detail media policies in greater detail and, as such, this section will not be exhaustive in content and policy guidelines.
