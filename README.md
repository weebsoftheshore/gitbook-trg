9/11/25

*   Expanded upon Player Communication chapter, adding in section [Prize Splits](player-communication/prize-splits.md) and [Judge Calls](player-communication/judge-calls.md), as well as Media Coverage with [Stream Judging](media-coverage/stream-judging.md).

    * Prize Split discussions are now explicitly not to be public. This is mostly to avoid situations where players may inadvertently use language that may suggest bribery or collusion without the intent of doing so (where it otherwise would be permissible). Matches are always expected to only result from either victory or concession (achieved in-game), or an intentional draw. The result can't be decided any other way.
    * Judge Calls has been expanded to give a more detailed view of how players are expected to handle judge calls and pitfalls to avoid during judge calls. It is our hope that these guidelines can curb either unwarranted or unintentional misuse of the judging system.
    * Slightly more depth given to expectations regarding Stream Judging. For judge-specific information, more detail is always available in the official [Judge Handbook](https://jh.gatcg.com/).





8/18/25

\
\
1/23/2025

* Minor revisions to draft format regarding deck constraints. Construction rules follow standard deck construction rules regarding allowable numbers of copies of a card in addition to requiring only up to a single copy of a card in the material deck. The original rules were put in place early during DOA as a draft format with variations on the rules taking place for subsequent drafts. The intention is to standardize all base draft rules to the now-changed version and allow for any format-specific rules to be enumerated within the format.
* Updated section on drafting procedure for limited tournaments, detailing inclusion of sealed draft packs. Also modified language regarding suggested time constraints.
* Updated card legality section.
* Slightly changed wording in the player equipment section regarding inappropriate materials.
* Correctly updated policy on Proxia's Vault (no time limitation clause for proxy eligibility duration)
* Added slight wording for Start of Game procedures to account for "False starts" when players begin before a round timer has begun.
* Added brief section covering Media regulations. This covers basic rules for media coverage at higher-tier competitive events (e.g. Ascent, National). Each event will detail media policies in greater detail and, as such, this section will not be exhaustive in content and policy guidelines.
