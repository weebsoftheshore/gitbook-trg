# Stream Judging

For livestreamed games, judges should be proactive in assisting with making the game state communicable to production, commentators, and the audience. This may include labeling of named cards, furnishing tokens, dice, or counters, or assisting with the layout of the game. If a judge at the streamed table feels a violation has been committed, they are to immediately pause the game and intervene to apply corrective procedures. If there is more than one judge dedicated to a livestreamed game, they should act in concert and discuss and violations, corrective procedures, or other matters to properly rectify a game. Additionally, penalties should be applied in conjunction with the infraction, regardless of the time point of the match; penalties should not be deferred if one is to be awarded.
