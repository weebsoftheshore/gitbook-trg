# Swiss Scoring and Tie-breaks

Swiss portions of a tournament should use the following values attributed to match records: A match win is worth 3 points, regardless of how many games are played. A match draw/tie is worth 1 point. A match loss is worth 0 points. Intentional draws should be reported as 0 wins and 0 losses for each player when entering scores. Omnidex will automatically award points for wins during the tournament and use the points earned, as well as opponents’ match-win percentage, player game-win percentage, opponents’ game-win percentage, and player registration times to factor in for tie-breaks.

A player’s opponents’ match-win percentage is the percent average of matches won out of matches played by each of that player’s opponents. A player’s game-win percentage is the percentage of games they have won. A player’s opponents’ game-win percentage is the percent average games won out of games played by each of that player’s opponents. Registration time is considered as the time at which a player registered; an earlier registration time trumps a later registration time.

If 3rd party software is used for generating, tournament pairings and standings, these parameters should be adjusted when setting up the tournament, if possible. Manual scoring is not recommended, however, if there is an absolute necessity for extraordinary circumstances, it may be permissible. If manual scoring is used, please refer to the Median-Bucholz-System for determining tie-breaks (See [this Wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie-breaking_in_Swiss-system_tournaments), ignoring Modified and Solkoff variants).
