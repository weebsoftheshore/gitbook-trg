# Outside Assistance

Players cannot seek play advice from spectators during a match. Spectators cannot give play advice to players. If there is a deck assembly or construction portion of a tournament, players cannot seek advice regarding deckbuilding and spectators cannot provide advice in this regard to a player until that player has submitted their deck list. If the tournament is of a limited format, players cannot seek out advice, strategic information, or information about pick selections from other players, spectators, or electronic media in the time between the pod seating arrangements are announced and when the draft is over. Players may also not consult physical notes brought with them during this time. Spectators should avoid making any remarks during drafting that might provide draft players outside or hidden information. Players should remain silent during drafting.

As mentioned in format conventions for [Team Standard Constructed](../format-conventions/team-standard-constructed.md), players in the seating arrangement A-B-C may communicate with each other such that player B may communicate with players A and C, but players A and C can each only communicate with player B; Players A and C can't communicate with each other at any time.
