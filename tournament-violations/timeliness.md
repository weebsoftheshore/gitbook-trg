# Timeliness

While complex game states can often occur in Grand Archive, players are expected to take their turns and complete their actions in a timely manner and, in doing so, adhere to any time limits specified for tournament settings. This also ensures that each player has had a fair opportunity to engage in the game. Playing slowly, intentionally or inadvertently, must be avoided, and judges can oversee games upon request to ensure that games progress on time.

Stalling a game is considered an escalation of slow play and ruled under unsporting conduct. Players are expected to start their match within 5 minutes of the round timer beginning. If both players fail to begin their match within those 5 minutes, they may both be penalized with a game loss according to the [IPG](https://ipg.gatcg.com/).
