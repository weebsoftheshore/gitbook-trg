# Unsporting Conduct

Unsporting behavior is not allowed. All players, spectators, and tournament officials are expected to behave respectfully and politely at all times. Tournament officials can examine issues regarding conduct and may take actions to avert further poor conduct. It is up to the discretion of judges, tournament officials, and/or venue management in how they wish to handle excessive unsporting behavior. In addition, players should not use listed rules and policies in such a way as to generate an advantage in the course of the tournament rather than using them for their intended purpose: ensuring fair and consistent gameplay in a safe and respectful setting. This has often been termed “rule-sharking” and will be considered unsporting conduct.



Other examples of unsporting conduct:

* Behavior that can reasonably or be expected to create feelings of harassment, bullying, or intimidation. Cyberbullying also falls into this category.
* Players repeatedly ask opponents to concede (more than once). This is considered intimidation.
* Acts that violate or can be seen as at risk of violating the safety or privacy of any persons involved in the tournament or at the tournament venue.
* Failure to comply with directions, instructions, or decisions made by a tournament official.
* Use of profanity, insulting tournament participants or any persons at a tournament venue, being involved in heated arguments with tournament participants or persons at the venue, or any similarly disruptive behavior.
* Intentionally stalling a game (playing slowly to gain an advantage).

It is understandable that some tournament settings cause a rise in competitive spirit among players and that disagreements are prone to happen in the course of the game, whether due to different interpretations of rules or as expressed discontent towards a certain game, situation, or result. Players may still discuss these topics civilly with each other and may always ask for a judge to mediate or assist in these interactions. If this behavior breaches the level of civility or respect that is expected and asked, it can be considered unsporting conduct.
