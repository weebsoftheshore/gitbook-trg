# Cheating

No form of cheating is allowed. If there is any suspicion of cheating, judges should be called to investigate. If a player is found to be cheating, they can be issued penalties such as, but not limited to, warnings, game or match losses, or disqualification from the tournament. Labeling an action as cheating requires that the player suspected of cheating is attempting to gain undue advantage from their actions and that the player is aware that performing that action is illegal. There is no “accidental” cheating; inadvertent errors or mistakes in the game can typically be resolved with the assistance of a judge and, in some cases, warned to prevent similar mistakes. However, continued or repetitive errors that produce a reasonable semblance of cheating are treated as cheating. Mistakes or errors committed in such a way as to gain an advantage is considered cheating.

Examples of cheating:

* Drawing extra cards without game permission and failing to notify a judge.
* Arranging a card or cards in the deck in an ordered manner when not instructed to do so by the game.
* Lying to a judge during an investigation about a game.
* Ignoring detrimental triggers (from the perspective of the player detrimentally affected)
* Adding outside cards to a limited format card pool.
* Players notice game errors in their favor and fail to notify a judge.
